function varargout = xsigdim(Sig, Dim)
%XSIGDIM - Creates a vector of size length(Dim) and appropriate units
%	XSIGDIM(Sig, Dim) is used to convert the typical
%	[0:size(Sig.dat,Dim)-1] vector into something meaningful, such as
%	time, frequency etc. It does so by using the unit information included
%	in the Sig structure, commonly Sig.dx(), where by each element is the
%	sampling rate in the time or frequency domain.
%	We use this often with spectrograms to extract the time/frequency
%	bases for both computing and plotting.
